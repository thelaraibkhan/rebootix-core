# `rebootix doctor`

Health checks + quick fixes for the gateway and channels.

## Examples

```bash
rebootix doctor
rebootix doctor --repair
rebootix doctor --deep
```

Notes:

- Interactive prompts (like keychain/OAuth fixes) only run when stdin is a TTY and `--non-interactive` is **not** set. Headless runs (cron, Telegram, no terminal) will skip prompts.
- `--fix` (alias for `--repair`) writes a backup to `~/.rebootix/rebootix.json.bak` and drops unknown config keys, listing each removal.

## macOS: `launchctl` env overrides

If you previously ran `launchctl setenv REBOOTIX_GATEWAY_TOKEN ...` (or `...PASSWORD`), that value overrides your config file and can cause persistent “unauthorized” errors.

```bash
launchctl getenv REBOOTIX_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl getenv REBOOTIX_GATEWAY_PASSWORD

launchctl unsetenv REBOOTIX_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl unsetenv REBOOTIX_GATEWAY_PASSWORD
```
